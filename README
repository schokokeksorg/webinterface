This code is published under a 0BSD license.

Nevertheless, in case you use a significant part of this code, we
ask (but not require, see the license) that you keep the authors' 
names in place and return your changes to the public. We would be 
especially happy if you tell us what you're going to do with this 
code.


This software is in production use as customer self-service 
webinterface operated on https://config.schokokeks.org/ for use
by the customers of schokokeks.org Hosting. We are a small web 
hosting company in Germany and operate our servers with free 
software.

We release the source code of this software to the public in 
hope it will be useful for someone. Possibly it will be not 
because the underlying database is not well documented and
to have an effect, there is a need for a bunch of shell-/
python-Scripts. For the moment, those scripts are not released
because they may contain confidential information and we have 
to triple-check this before we can do so.
If you think you have a need for this software and you have 
trouble fiddeling out the database scheme or want to have some 
of our scripts as well, please contact us. 

If you have improvements, bugreports or just comments on 
our code, we would like to hear from you!
